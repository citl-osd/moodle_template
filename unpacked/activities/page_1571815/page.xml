    <name>How to Access Readings</name>
    <intro></intro>
    <introformat>1</introformat>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;This course uses a variety of methods to access course materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;E-Reserves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University Library has adopted a new e-reserves system. To gain access to the e-reserve items for this course, you must first use your NetID and AD password to &lt;a href="https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/" target="_blank"&gt;log in to the E-Reserves System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HELP:Â &lt;/strong&gt;For help accessing e-reserves, please see the &lt;a href="http://uiuc.libguides.com/reserves"&gt;Electronic Reserves Guide&lt;/a&gt;. If your question isn't answered in the Electronic Reserves Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; You will not see your courses and e-reserves for approximately four hours after logging in for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SIPX Reserve Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you will click on an item in your e-reserves list and it will take you to the SIPX website and ask you to log in. Don't worry, this is a legitimate resource to log into. The University Library uses SIPX for e-reserves that it needs to pay permissions for. Currently, you will have to create a very simple account (consisting of only a login, your name, and university email address) validating that you are a U of I student. You will receive a single email from the system to verify the email account. After responding to the email verification request, you will be able to log in with your NetID and password like any other U of I resource. To create the account, simply click on any of your e-reserves that direct you to the SIPX website. All fees associated with the SIPX service are paid for by the University Library, and any data collected is only reported in the aggregate. No specific student information is shared without specific consent. &lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; If you create a SIPX account using any email address other than your netid@illinois.edu account, the site will ask you, rather than the library, to pay for the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VPN (Virtual Private Network)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are off campus or not connected to University of Illinois Internet, you may need to have a VPN in order to access some of your readings. Please visit the &lt;a href="https://www.cites.illinois.edu/vpn/download-install.html"&gt;VPN Downloads and Installation&lt;/a&gt; page to download the VPN that you need.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
